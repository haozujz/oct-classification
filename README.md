# Retinal OCT - image classification

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wLVfjqzkYFHlc3R-9DkhoAKa8VaK24kp?usp=sharing

Simple multi-class image classification of retinal Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Classes: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) / Diabetic macular edema (DME) / Drusen / Normal.  
Note: Some plots may only render via the above link but not on github.

## Potential updates
- scale down model, reduce training & inference time
- freeze model and measure FLOPS
- compute optimal learning rate
